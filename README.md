# Abstract
Machine learning can simplify and quicken the drug development process by predicting specific
properties of molecules. Recently, much progress has been made on predicting molecular features
with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs require a fixed-size vector as
an input which implies that the 3D structure of the molecule has to be projected into the
lower-dimensional representation. This dimensionality reduction leads to information loss and a
worse explainability of the model. As the molecular data is innately represented by the graph
structures, convolutions over graphs might be a better approach. Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) is a novel deep learning architecture that allows training models directly on graph-like
structures. This work applies GCNs to predict solubility which is a crucial molecular property
in the drug development process. The novelty of the work is that instead of focusing on the
accuracy of predictions, different explainability methods are applied to deepen our understanding
of molecular features that affect the solubility.

# Installation tips
The conda environment has been saved as env_info.yaml
You can reproduce the environment by simply running the command:
`conda env create -f env_info.yaml`
It will create a conda enviroment with all libraries that were used for the project. If that doesn't work, install them manually from the file.
## Rdkit
Works only when downloaded with Conda.

## Tensorflow GPU
TF 2.0 and TF 1.14 Works only with CUDA 10.0. Version 10.1 doesn't work!
